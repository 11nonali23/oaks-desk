# Pokemon API

## Why
I found on Kaggle an interesting dataset regarding all 8 generations pokemon.
So I decided to create an API to retrieve useful informations about pokemons, trying to 
think about what gamers need to know when playing this game.

## Technologies
This project uses Django and django-rest-framework.
